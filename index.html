						<dd>&#45; May my goodness and honesty preserve me, because I trust in you. Psalm 25:21</dd>

						<dd>&#45; Never let go loyalty and faithfulness. Tie them around your neck; write them on you heart. Proverbs 3:3</dd>
					<dt>COURAGE</dt>
						<dd>&#45; Just be determine, be confident; and make sure that you obey the whole Law that my servant Moses gave you. Joshua 1:7
						<br>&#45; Remember that I have commanded you to be determined and confident! Do not be afraid or discourage, for I, the Lord your God, am with you wherever you go. Joshua 1:9</dd>
					<dt>COMPETENCE</dt>
						<dd>&#45; There is nothing in us that allows us to claim that we are capable of doing this work.

The written law brings death, but the Spirit gives life. 2 Corinthians 3:5-6</dd>
